# Economics-of-Change
The presentation analyzes economic transitions in 65 countries using World Bank data, focusing on income mobility, poverty reduction, and inequality between 1980â€“2020. Tools like mobility matrices, Growth Incidence Curves, and Dollar-Kraay regressions reveal how GDP per capita growth affects the poorest 20%. Results show varied mobility across countries, with growth generally benefiting the poor. Regional and income-group differences highlight the need for inclusive policies, structural reforms, and global trade integration for sustainable development.
